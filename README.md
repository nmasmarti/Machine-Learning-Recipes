# Machine Learning Recipes

This repository contains codes for the various Machine Learning algorithms, that are discussed in the medium articles. The dataset used in the various models can be found in the [~/dataset](https://github.com/thisisashwinraj/Machine-Learning-Recipes/tree/master/datasets) dir. The various ML models are built on Google Colab Notebook, since most of the required packages are pre-installed. The notebooks can be run locally, or on other platforms by downloading notebooks from this repository.
